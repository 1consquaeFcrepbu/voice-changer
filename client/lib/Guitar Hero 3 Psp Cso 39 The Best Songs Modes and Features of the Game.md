After copying the game file, you can launch PPSSPP on your PSP and browse to the "GAME" folder. You should see Guitar Hero III Legends of Rock listed there. Select it and press X to start playing. You will need to configure the controls according to your preference. You can use a keyboard or a controller if you have one, or you can use the PSP buttons and analog stick.

If you want to play competitively or unlock new songs, you can choose Career mode. This mode lets you create a custom character and a band name, and then take on various gigs in different venues. You will have to play a set of songs in each gig, and earn stars based on your performance. The more stars you earn, the more money you get, which you can use to buy new guitars, outfits, and songs. You will also unlock new gigs and venues as you progress.
 
If you want to play with or against another player, you can choose Multiplayer mode. This mode lets you connect with another PSP user who has the same game and play together using the wireless feature. You can choose from two modes: Co-op and Face-Off. In Co-op mode, you and your partner play the same song together, each taking a different part of the guitar track. In Face-Off mode, you and your opponent play the same song separately, each trying to outscore the other.
 
If you want to learn some tips and tricks, you can choose Training mode. This mode lets you access some tutorials and practice sessions that will help you improve your skills. You can learn how to use the whammy bar, how to perform hammer-ons and pull-offs, how to activate star power, and more. You can also practice any song that you have unlocked at your own pace.
 
4 Rock on - Once you have chosen a game mode and a song, it's time to play. You will see a virtual fretboard on the screen, with colored notes scrolling down from top to bottom. Each note corresponds to one of the fret buttons on your guitar. Your goal is to press the correct fret button and strum at the same time as the note reaches the bottom of the screen. If you do it correctly, you will hear the note played and see it light up on the screen. If you miss it, you will hear a clank sound and see it turn gray.
 
As you play, you will notice that some notes are longer than others. These are called sustained notes or chords. To play them, you have to hold down the fret button and strum once, then use the whammy bar to modulate the sound while holding it. You will also notice that some notes are glowing with star power. These are special notes that fill up your star power meter when you hit them. When your meter is at least half full, you can activate star power by tilting your guitar vertically or pressing select. Star power doubles your score multiplier and makes your performance more impressive.
 
The game will rate your performance based on how many notes you hit correctly and how well you keep your rock meter high. The rock meter is a gauge that shows how much the crowd likes your performance. It ranges from green (good) to red (bad). If it drops too low, you will fail the song and get booed off the stage. To keep it high, you have to hit as many notes as possible and avoid missing too many in a row.
 
Playing Guitar Hero on PSP is a fun and challenging way to enjoy your favorite music. You can play along with songs by artists like Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nirvana, Muse, Foo Fighters, and more. You can also customize your character and guitar with different styles and colors. Whether you want to play solo or with a friend, Guitar Hero on PSP will make you feel like a rock star.
