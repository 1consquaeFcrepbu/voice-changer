In this article, we will show you how to install and use patch V6 for Diagbox V6 01. This patch works with Windows XP only and is compatible with most clone interfaces such as PSA XS Evolution and Lexia3. You will need the following files:
 
- Diagbox V6 01.iso (1.03 GB)
- patchV6.exe (7.5 KB)
- Diagbox Update V6 01 to V6 19.exe (195.27 MB)

You can download these files from various sources on the internet, such as MHH AUTO forum or torrent sites. Make sure you scan them for viruses before using them.
 
## Step 1: Install Diagbox V6 01
 
Mount the Diagbox V6 01.iso file on a DVD or a virtual drive using a software such as Daemon Tools or PowerISO. Run the setup.exe file and follow the instructions on the screen. You will need to enter a serial number during the installation. You can use any random number such as 1234567.
 
## Step 2: Apply patch V6
 
Copy the patchV6.exe file to C:\AWRoot\bin\fi\cache\ folder. Run it and you should see a success message. This will modify some files in the Diagbox folder to make it work with clone interfaces and to disable online updates.
 
## Step 3: Update Diagbox to V6 19
 
Run the Diagbox Update V6 01 to V6 19.exe file and enter the password scary01 when prompted. This will update your Diagbox software to the latest version available. You will need to activate it again after the update.
 
## Step 4: Activate Diagbox
 
Run Diagbox from your desktop shortcut and click on activation (the finger with the hand icon). You will see two fields on the screen. In the first one, enter 12345678901234567890123456789011 and in the second one enter 02FFFFFFF. Click OK and you should see a message that your tokens are installed and PP2000 and Lexia are activated.
 
## Step 5: Connect your interface and use Diagbox
 
Connect your clone interface to your computer via USB port and wait for the drivers to be installed automatically. You can also use PSA Interface Checker software to change the firmware of your interface if needed. Run Diagbox again and select your vehicle model and type. You can now perform various functions on your car using Diagbox.
 
Note: If your interface does not see your car or just identifies the VIN, you may need to use PSA Interface Checker software to change the firmware of your interface. You can also use TLCD utility by vadimus\_ca (idea by mudrec1980) to disable the code request for telecoding.

- The interface does not communicate with the car or shows errors. This may be due to a faulty interface, a bad connection, a wrong firmware or a wrong protocol. Check your interface with PSA Interface Checker software and change the firmware if needed. Make sure your interface is connected properly and use the correct protocol for your car (CAN or VAN).
